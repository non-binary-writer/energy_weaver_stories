# Felix's Introduction to the Energy Weaving Universe

Felix was sitting at his parents farm after a long drive home from university. His parents and sister were at the lake, but he had told them he was going to go look at the stars. It was true, but no the whole story. 

Felix was drove home wearing a skirt and a rock T-shirt. That type of outfit is his favourite, but he feels that he cannot wear that type of thing in front of his family because it goes against all of his instincts about what 'girls' wear and what 'boys' wear. Which is why the real reason Felix wanted to look at the stars was so that he could think about gender roles and the lies society tells us alone with only the stars as company. He spent over an hour outside looking through the telescope thinking and drinking beer, and now, with the telescope safely stowed away, he was continuing to think while reading a book about how homosexuals are treated in the movies. 

Even when he is all alone like this he is on high alert. He is constantly watching the window for lights entering the farm yard in case someone from his family comes by unannouced. He even keeps the music playing from the TV at a low level such that he could possibly here someone pull in. Only a couple of times he has almost gotten caught wearing traditionally female clothing, but it is enough that he is terrified of being caught. 

A voice in the back of Felix's mind tells him how ridicoulus it is for him to be so terrified, but constant vigilence still wins. That is why Felix was shocked to find a man staring at him wearing a leather jacket and a pair of ripped jeans. He had an amiable smile on his face and his head was leaning to one shoulder like he was in deep thought. 

Felix felt like he was going to have a heart attack, and desparately looked for a blanket or something to cover what he was wearing. Then he jumped to the fact a stranger was in the room and maybe it was a robber. Felix was then having trouble deciding whether to fight, run, or hide the fact he was wearing a skirt. 

"I would attack an intruder myself instead of run," the man said with a tone of a teacher speaking to a student. "And I have no idea why you would want to hide your skirt if it is the clothing your most comfortable in."

"I ah um," Felix mumbled. He was thinking of the stigma and the shame he had wearing this type of clothing. He was starting to get a headache just like he does when he dresses like this in public. 

"Look that bitch God says a lot of things that are patently false just to control people," the man started angrily. Then his tone softened, "your just starting to question the lies, but you will not have these conflicting feelings after a while."

Felix looked at the man confused. The way he talked about God was with contempt, but almost like he knew God personally. Felix also did agree that he had nothing to be ashamed of, in fact, he felt shame about feeling shame. None of those conflicting thoughts changed the thought that Felix felt he should be wearing conventional clothing in front of this strange man who must know his family (why else would he be here). 

"I know no one in your family, but if you truly feel the need to change clothes go ahead," the man said. 

"How do you know what I am thinking?" Felix said. In the shock of being caught wearing a skirt at his parents house he seemed to have skipped over the fact that this man seemed to know what he was thinking. 

"Well you are practically projecting your thoughts out," the man replied. "I could try to block them, but I want to transport us back to Ranjon."

"Ok. I am confused. What the hell is going on," Felix said. He was truly confused now. What the hell is Ranjon, and why would this man have to block his thoughts. 

"Well that would take a long time to explain," the man started. "What you have to know now is that humanity is somehow able to do things that could be characterized as magic by changing and moving energy. Conservation of energy can never be broken. Ranjon is a planet a couple of light years away."

"That makes no sense," Felix said. Regaining some of his thoughts, and his physics knowledge was starting to kick in. "To transport light years away faster than those light years would have to violate conservation of energy."

"Don't be a smart ass. It is not quite understood, but there is a network or something that makes it possible," the man said irritably. "I am not a scientist and I have no idea how it works."

- the man explains that most have been controled by God's lies
- felix agrees to go to Ranjon
